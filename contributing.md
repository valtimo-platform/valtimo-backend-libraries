# How to contribute

We welcome you to contribute to this project. 

## Development or bugfixes

Your help is appreciated. Please contact the project maintainers in advance. This is to reduce the work that is required, as it can both reduce the chances of feedback and allows for the Valtimo team to provide some pointers on how to proceed. It is not necessary to do this for smaller bugfixes.
All information can be found on https://docs.valtimo.nl/readme/contributing
