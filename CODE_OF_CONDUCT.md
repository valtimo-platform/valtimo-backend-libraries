# Valtimo Code of Conduct


We – the project maintainers @ritense – work with pleasure on building this open source product. We welcome all contributions, questions, opinions and suggestions. We strive to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

*   Using welcoming and inclusive language.
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
*   Focusing on what is best for the community.
*   Showing empathy towards other community members.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
    advances.
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
    address, without explicit permission.
*   Conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate for the forum in
    which it occurs.

All Valtimo public spaces are meant for professional interactions, and any behavior which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting is unacceptable.


## Our Responsibilities

Ritense is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Ritense has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.


## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all content on Github.com/valtimo-platform, https://docs.valtimo.nl/, https://www.valtimo.nl/, https://forum.valtimo.nl/, Slack and or any other official Valtimo web presence allowing for community interactions, as well as at all official Valtimo events, whether offline or online.


## Conflict Resolution

Conflicts in an open source project can take many forms, from someone having a bad day and using harsh and hurtful language in the issue queue, to more serious instances such as sexist/racist statements or threats of violence, and everything in between.

If the behavior is threatening or harassing, or for other reasons requires immediate escalation, please see below.

However, for the vast majority of issues, we aim to empower individuals to first resolve conflicts themselves, asking for help when needed, and only after that fails to escalate further. This approach gives people more control over the outcome of their dispute. 

If you are experiencing or witnessing conflict, we ask you to use the following escalation strategy to address the conflict:

1.  Address the perceived conflict directly with those involved, preferably in a real-time medium.
2.  If this fails, get a third party (e.g. a mutual friend, and/or someone with background on the issue, but not involved in the conflict) to intercede.
3.  If you are still unable to resolve the conflict, and you believe it rises to harassment or another code of conduct violation, report it.

## Reporting Violations

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, report it as soon as possible, to help us make the community a better place. Please include as much detail as possible in your report as it is easier for us to address issues when we have more context. Please email to security@ritense.com or contact via +31 20 3460800
